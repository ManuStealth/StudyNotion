## Front-end
The front end is built using ReactJS, enabling dynamic and responsive user interfaces for an engaging learning experience. It communicates with the back end through RESTful API calls.

The StudyNotion front end is designed using Figma, offering a clean and minimal user interface. It includes various pages for students, instructors, and future admin features. Some key pages are:

- Homepage
- Course List
- Wishlist
- Cart Checkout
- Course Content
- User Details
- User Edit Details
- Dashboard (for instructors)
- Insights (for instructors)
- Course Management Pages (for instructors)
- View and Edit Profile Details (for instructors)
- Dashboard (for admin, future scope)
- Insights (for admin, future scope)
- Instructor Management (for admin, future scope)
- Frameworks and libraries such as ReactJS, CSS, Tailwind, Redux, and VSCode are used for front-end development.

## Back-end
The back end is developed with NodeJS and ExpressJS, providing APIs for user authentication, course management, and content processing. It also incorporates MongoDB for flexible data storage and retrieval.

The StudyNotion back end follows a monolithic architecture, utilizing Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Key features include:

- User authentication and authorization
- Course management
- Payment integration (Razorpay)
- Cloud-based media management (Cloudinary)
- Markdown formatting for course content

Frameworks, libraries, and tools used include Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, JWT, Bcrypt, and Mongoose. Data models encompass student  schema, instructor schema, and course schema.

## Database and Data Model

The database for the platform is built using MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution. MongoDB allows for the storage of unstructured and semi-structured data, which is useful for storing course content such as videos, images, and PDFs. The database stores the course content, user data, and other relevant information related to the platform.

## API Design

StudyNotion's API adheres to the REST architectural style, implemented using Node.js and Express.js. It uses JSON for data exchange and supports standard HTTP request methods. Sample API endpoints include:

- /api/auth/signup (POST)
- /api/auth/login (POST)
- /api/auth/verify-otp (POST)
- /api/auth/forgot-password (POST)
- /api/courses (GET, POST)
- /api/courses/:id (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- /api/courses/:id/rate (POST)
Sample API requests and responses are provided for each endpoint, ensuring seamless communication between front end and back end.

## Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools

- Node.js: Node.js is used as the primary framework for the back end.
- MongoDB: MongoDB is used as the primary database, providing a flexible and scalable data storage solution.
- Express.js: Express.js is used as a web application framework, providing a range of features and tools for building web applications.
- JWT: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for authentication and authorization, providing a secure and reliable way to manage user credentials.
- Bcrypt: Bcrypt is used for password hashing, adding an extra layer of security to user data.
- Mongoose: Mongoose is used as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, providing a way to interact with MongoDB using JavaScript.
